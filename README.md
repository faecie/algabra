Playing around datastructures and algorithms. This repo is only for academic study


#### Do not use these models in production

These models were designed to reproduce original classic implementation of data structures (eg. fixed arrays, stacks, heaps) 
and classic algorithms. In general these models are not so efficient as built-in
Python structures and methods (like sorting, intersecting etc.) and work well only for few cases.
It means that in certain cases their behavior is unexpected
